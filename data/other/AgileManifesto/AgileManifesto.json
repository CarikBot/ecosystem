What emerged was the Agile \u2018Software Development\u2019 Manifesto. Representatives from Extreme Programming, SCRUM, DSDM, Adaptive Software Development, Crystal, Feature-Driven Development, Pragmatic Programming, and others sympathetic to the need for an alternative to documentation driven, heavyweight software development processes convened.\n\nNow, a bigger gathering of organizational anarchists would be hard to find, so what emerged from this meeting was symbolic\u2014a Manifesto for Agile Software Development\u2014signed by all participants. The only concern with the term agile came from Martin Fowler (a Brit for those who don\u2019t know him) who allowed that most Americans didn\u2019t know how to pronounce the word \u2018agile\u2019.\n\nAlistair Cockburn\u2019s initial concerns reflected the early thoughts of many participants. \"I personally didn't expect that this particular group of agilites to ever agree on anything substantive.\" But his post-meeting feelings were also shared, \"Speaking for myself, I am delighted by the final phrasing [of the Manifesto]. I was surprised that the others appeared equally delighted by the final phrasing. So we did agree on something substantive.\"\n\nNaming ourselves \"The Agile Alliance,\" this group of independent thinkers about software development, and sometimes competitors to each other, agreed on the Manifesto for Agile Software Development displayed on the title page of this web site.\n\nBut while the Manifesto provides some specific ideas, there is a deeper theme that drives many, but not all, to be sure, members of the alliance. At the close of the two-day meeting, Bob Martin joked that he was about to make a \"mushy\" statement. But while tinged with humor, few disagreed with Bob\u2019s sentiments\u2014that we all felt privileged to work with a group of people who held a set of compatible values, a set of values based on trust and respect for each other and promoting organizational models based on people, collaboration, and building the types of organizational communities in which we would want to work. At the core, I believe Agile Methodologists are really about \"mushy\" stuff\u2014about delivering good products to customers by operating in an environment that does more than talk about \"people as our most important asset\" but actually \"acts\" as if people were the most important, and lose the word \"asset\". So in the final analysis, the meteoric rise of interest in\u2014and sometimes tremendous criticism of\u2014Agile Methodologies is about the mushy stuff of values and culture.\n\nFor example, I think that ultimately, Extreme Programming has mushroomed in use and interest, not because of pair-programming or refactoring, but because, taken as a whole, the practices define a developer community freed from the baggage of Dilbertesque corporations. Kent Beck tells the story of an early job in which he estimated a programming effort of six weeks for two people. After his manager reassigned the other programmer at the beginning of the project, he completed the project in twelve weeks\u2014and felt terrible about himself! The boss\u2014of course\u2014harangued Kent about how slow he was throughout the second six weeks. Kent, somewhat despondent because he was such a \"failure\" as a programmer, finally realized that his original estimate of 6 weeks was extremely accurate\u2014for 2 people\u2014and that his \"failure\" was really the manager\u2019s failure , indeed, the failure of the standard \"fixed\" process mindset that so frequently plagues our industry.\n\n[More Detail](https:\/\/agilemanifesto.org\/history.html)"],"pattern":["about agile manifesto","about agile"]},"\ud83c\udfc6 Agile Indonesia":{"intent":"AgileManifesto-Agile-Indonesia","id":"243kq8hnan80l383tnv6autphs","type":"action","text":["*Agile Indonesia*\n\nDiscuss anything under the umbrella of Agilemanifesto.org and its 40+ practices.
