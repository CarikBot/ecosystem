                *Manifesto for Agile Software Development*

_We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it._

Through this work we have come to value:
*Individuals and interactions* over processes and tools
*Working software* over comprehensive documentation
*Customer collaboration* over contract negotiation
*Responding to change* over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more.

Agile processes harness change for&#10;the customer's competitive advantage.&#10;&#10;Deliver working software frequently, from a&#10;couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a&#10;preference to the shorter timescale.&#10;&#10;Business people and developers must work&#10;together daily throughout the project.&#10;&#10;Build projects around motivated individuals.&#10;Give them the environment and support they need,&#10;and trust them to get the job done.&#10;&#10;The most efficient and effective method of&#10;conveying information to and within a development&#10;team is face-to-face conversation.&#10;&#10;Working software is the primary measure of progress.&#10;&#10;Agile processes promote sustainable development.&#10;The sponsors, developers, and users should be able&#10;to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.&#10;&#10;Continuous attention to technical excellence&#10;and good design enhances agility.&#10;&#10;Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount&#10;of work not done--is essential.&#10;&#10;The best architectures, requirements, and designs&#10;emerge from self-organizing teams.&#10;&#10;At regular intervals, the team reflects on how&#10;to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts&#10;its behavior accordingly. &#10;&#10;[AgileManifesto.org](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html)&#10;">

            <node BACKGROUND_COLOR="#F2F2F2" FOLDER="true" ID="6pl8fv6r4qsohga07b1reqibng" TEXT="*History: The Agile Manifesto*&#10;&#10;On February 11-13, 2001, at The Lodge at Snowbird ski resort in the Wasatch mountains of Utah, seventeen people met to talk, ski, relax, and try to find common ground—and of course, to eat. What emerged was the Agile ‘Software Development’ Manifesto. Representatives from Extreme Programming, SCRUM, DSDM, Adaptive Software Development, Crystal, Feature-Driven Development, Pragmatic Programming, and others sympathetic to the need for an alternative to documentation driven, heavyweight software development processes convened.&#10;&#10;Now, a bigger gathering of organizational anarchists would be hard to find, so what emerged from this meeting was symbolic—a Manifesto for Agile Software Development—signed by all participants. The only concern with the term agile came from Martin Fowler (a Brit for those who don’t know him) who allowed that most Americans didn’t know how to pronounce the word ‘agile’.&#10;&#10;Alistair Cockburn’s initial concerns reflected the early thoughts of many participants. &quot;I personally didn't expect that this particular group of agilites to ever agree on anything substantive.&quot; But his post-meeting feelings were also shared, &quot;Speaking for myself, I am delighted by the final phrasing [of the Manifesto]. I was surprised that the others appeared equally delighted by the final phrasing. So we did agree on something substantive.&quot;&#10;&#10;Naming ourselves &quot;The Agile Alliance,&quot; this group of independent thinkers about software development, and sometimes competitors to each other, agreed on the Manifesto for Agile Software Development displayed on the title page of this web site.&#10;&#10;But while the Manifesto provides some specific ideas, there is a deeper theme that drives many, but not all, to be sure, members of the alliance. At the close of the two-day meeting, Bob Martin joked that he was about to make a &quot;mushy&quot; statement. But while tinged with humor, few disagreed with Bob’s sentiments—that we all felt privileged to work with a group of people who held a set of compatible values, a set of values based on trust and respect for each other and promoting organizational models based on people, collaboration, and building the types of organizational communities in which we would want to work. At the core, I believe Agile Methodologists are really about &quot;mushy&quot; stuff—about delivering good products to customers by operating in an environment that does more than talk about &quot;people as our most important asset&quot; but actually &quot;acts&quot; as if people were the most important, and lose the word &quot;asset&quot;. So in the final analysis, the meteoric rise of interest in—and sometimes tremendous criticism of—Agile Methodologies is about the mushy stuff of values and culture.&#10;&#10;For example, I think that ultimately, Extreme Programming has mushroomed in use and interest, not because of pair-programming or refactoring, but because, taken as a whole, the practices define a developer community freed from the baggage of Dilbertesque corporations. Kent Beck tells the story of an early job in which he estimated a programming effort of six weeks for two people. After his manager reassigned the other programmer at the beginning of the project, he completed the project in twelve weeks—and felt terrible about himself! The boss—of course—harangued Kent about how slow he was throughout the second six weeks. Kent, somewhat despondent because he was such a &quot;failure&quot; as a programmer, finally realized that his original estimate of 6 weeks was extremely accurate—for 2 people—and that his &quot;failure&quot; was really the manager’s failure , indeed, the failure of the standard &quot;fixed&quot; process mindset that so frequently plagues our industry.&#10;&#10;[More Detail](https://agilemanifesto.org/history.html)">
